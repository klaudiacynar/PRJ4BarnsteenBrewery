We want the festival to be as impactful as it can be as you can only have a first launch once. The festival consists of food stands and live music, as well as cultural workshops. There will be a large seating area in the middle where people can meet and have our drink. The beer can be purchased anywhere in the venue. We will also invite influencers to the launch and they will also promote our event and content beforehand.

                <p class="lead text-justify">
                    We learned that running a social media page can be challenging. We really had to have good commitment to posting as much as we could. We chose to post every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. However, next time we believe we can reach more people by posting daily. We also had challenges coming up with the content for our posts because we wanted to keep everything consistent with both the layout and appearance. We expected to get more likes considering our follower count. At this moment we have 59 followers which was what we wanted to achieve in our objective. With this follower count we expected to get at least half of the likes (27) but we got at most 16 likes. This shows us that we need to create more engaging content, for example using interactive features on stories or asking our followers questions in our captions. Analytics are pr

                     <br>
                    We also managed to reach many more accounts than likes on posts. This was helped through the use of hashtags. The question is, how do we get these people to interact with our post in the future. Unfortunately, we did not get enough followers to see the demographics because instagram requires you to have 100 followers to use this feature.  We are unsure if our affect objective works as there is no way of measuring that however we can assume that by them interacting with post shows they are interested in our brand. For response it is also hard to analyze since they cannot actually buy our products but they can interact with our promotion posts. Overall we are satisfied with the execution of the communication and media plan as we achieved our goals.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    In the future, we would like to reach more accounts and get more engagement on our posts. We found that our video content had the most reach and engagement therefore in the future more should be made. Our content was quite limited and random, when we created something, it would be our first thought for content. To improve, we would need to create better concepts and related posts that flow in a nice sequence. In addition to the sequence, our layout does not exactly match, so we would like to only stick to the color theme. We would also improve our planning schedule where we would post daily instead of every second day. This would keep the engagements high and encourage more creative content. Furthermore, the use of interactive features should also be improved. We did not make use of the stories section too well that includes polls, questions, and other features. The lack of interaction on our posts comes with a bit of concern that our posts are not doing too well. There were a few comments from people telling us to promote our account on bigger beer accounts that founded us through hashtags however we did not do that since our brand is not real.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                    If the project continued, we would have liked to execute our PR plan of having a festival or event to see how well that would boost our social media and popularity. Our posts were all mockups with our logos when we presented the bottle however in the future we should invest in creating a real life prototype for posts. That way we can organize photoshoots and content without the use of creative commons and photoshop. In addition, we need to make sure we are not rushing to create any of the content and create things all in advance to schedule.
